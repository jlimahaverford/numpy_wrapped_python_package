# requests_wrapped_python_package
Python package with one dependency, the requests package.  This project was created as a minimal example of introducing a non-standard-library python package as a dependency python development.  While many examples exist, they all seem to strike the same middle-ground between minimal and exhaustive.  This is minimal.

To install:

- pip install -e git+https://github.com/jlimahaverford/hello_world_python_package.git#egg=requests_wrapped_python_package
